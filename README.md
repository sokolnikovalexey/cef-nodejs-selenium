How to start testing CEF applications with node and selenium

This is new version of https://github.com/sokolnikovalexey/cef-pyhton-selenium
Because of some problems with library versions i can't run it now too.
Now I'am using nodejs + mocha instead of python. I think it is better solution for some reasons.

This repo is kind of answer for StackOverflow Question on my previous tutorial "cef-pyhton-selenium"
